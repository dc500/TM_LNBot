# TicketMaster/LiveNation Bot
I modified it for K fans for educational and personal use.

**2020 Update - I origtinally modified this rep to help KPOP fans get tickets because non-fans buy them all. The bot doesn't work anymore for KPOP. TM has resorted to lousy Java (I think) and Verified Fan which is worse than BOTS. It makes things easier for the so called scalpers. The people with the money. Think about it,it only cost $60/year for mobile phone service on 12 lines + you can buy a bulk a of burners off eBay or from the FED gov.1/4 of a sell will cover the cost of outsmarting TM. Get some sims, line the phones up on a table, and pinch/click/tap. That or run a bunch of virtual desktops from/with non-cloud IPs. Just be warned, the queue number is being stored/associated with your account AND device. If you clear local storage - it will remember your username. CLEAN LOCAL STORAGE and USE a different user name. It's the only loophole.**

**Important:** 
This bot is for educational and personal use.  
Under no circumstances do I recommend buying tickets with the purpose of selling for profit.  
The author of these scripts takes no responsibility for any misuse associated with them.

Note: This bot is designed to only work with Ticketmaster's new website. (i.e. url starts with 'www1.ticketmaster.')
It will attempt to add the default number of lowest price tickets to the cart. You can then finish the purchase as normal.
You can change the number of tickets by modifying the numberOfTickets variable in the script. (Instructions to follow)

If this Bot successfully secures you tickets please donate.  
Donations encourage me to maintain the code and ensure it keeps working for future use!

3) Navigate to a 'www1.ticketmaster.' ticket page shortly before the tickets are due to go on sale.
The bot will automatically refresh regularly if the tickets aren't yet on sale.

Tip: Test it out on a page were tickets are already on sale. <br>
Tip: Run multiple tabs (But be careful!!!, too many requests and you risk getting blocked by Ticketmaster)
